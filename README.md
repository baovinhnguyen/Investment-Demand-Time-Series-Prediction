# Investment-Demand-Time-Series-Prediction
Time-series empirical project for Advanced Econometrics course at Tufts University

- The purpose of the project is to apply various time-series methods to determine the most suitable time-series prediction model. 
- The independent variable is Investment ( U.S. gross private domestic fixed business investment in Billions of chained (2005) dollars).
- The dependent variable is Demand (U.S. gross domestic business product in billions of chained (2005) dollars).
- I applied the following time-series methods:
  - Determine if the dependent variable is trending over the provided time period of analysis. 
  - Test for Granger causality.
  - Test for ARCH/ GARCH.
  - Test for lag length.
  - Test for 1st-order and 4th-order serial correlation in the residuals using Durbin's Alternative Test.
  - Test for seasonality. 
  - Test to see if the dependent variable or the independent variables should be first-differenced using the Dickey-Fuller test. 
  - Test for cointegration and then determine if an error correction model is appropriate. 
  - After forecasting, carry out the Predictive Accuracy Test. 
- The chosen programming language in the paper is Stata.
